Getting Started
---------------
NYTimesBooK uses New York Times API to load books on the library screen. To use the API, you will need to obtain a free developer API key. First create an account and then go to [myapps](https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps) on your profile and add new app. See the York Times API [Documentation](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview) for instructions.

Once you have the key, add this line to the `local.properties` file:

```
BOOK_API = your New York Times API key
```
The app is unusable without an API key.
